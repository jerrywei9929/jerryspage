								<p>Hi ! my name is Qi Ming Wei and I often go by Jerry.</p> 

									<P>I am a recent graduate from Seattle University with a degree in Business Analytics and Finance. I have a strong passion to learn about data because I want to become an sucessful entrepreneur and I really love the idea of leverging data to drive business decisions.</p> 
									
									<P>During my college times I have tried starting my first catering company Three Bites LLC  where my job is to handle the legal obligation as well as the branding for the company. It was during that time that I wish I knew more about data.</P> 
									
									<p>I am curretly a Data ops intern at People Tech Group, where we help migrate hybrid work loads from cloud to the new AWS for more easy and scalable development. From this internship I have learned and mastered several programing languages as well as visualization tools such as R, PYTHON, Tableau, Microsoft Azure and SQL. </P>
									<P>I have also competed in the cartpole V1 OpenAi challenge where there is a pole joint with a cart and the goal is to prevent it from falling over using Python Tensorflow. I have also created a visual tracker on the impact of COVID - 19 on hospitalized rates in the US. The goal is to see if there is any correlations between the virus and the increasing rate of hospitalization in the US. </p>
									
									<P>Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar, Traveling for food, and working on DIY projects. I am currently working on building my own electric long board. </p>
